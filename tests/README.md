# Test Suite Summary

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Jinja2 Web Evaluator, specifically focused on the new input files functionality.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `unit_tests.py`
**Purpose**: Basic endpoint validation
- Tests all server endpoints for correct HTTP status codes
- Validates response formats and error handling
- Quick smoke test to ensure server is functional

**Key Tests**:
- Root page accessibility (200)
- Input files endpoint (empty array when no directory configured)
- Settings endpoints (GET/POST operations)
- History endpoints
- Error handling (404 for invalid endpoints, 400 for missing parameters)

### 2. `workflow_test.py`
**Purpose**: Complete input files workflow validation
- End-to-end testing of input files functionality
- Security testing (path traversal protection)
- Integration testing with rendering

**Key Tests**:
- Configuration management (setting and reading input directory)
- File discovery and listing
- File content reading
- Security validation (prevents path traversal attacks)
- Integration with Jinja2 rendering
- Error condition handling

### 3. `user_simulation.py`
**Purpose**: Realistic user workflow simulation
- Simulates how a real user would interact with the system
- Tests complex real-world scenarios
- Validates complete feature integration

**Key Tests**:
- Creating sample data files (employees, servers, configuration)
- User configuring input directory
- Loading and browsing files through web interface
- Creating complex Jinja2 templates
- Rendering professional reports and configurations
- History tracking validation

## Test Results Summary

All tests pass successfully, validating:

✅ **Endpoint Functionality**: All HTTP endpoints work correctly with proper status codes
✅ **Configuration Management**: Settings can be saved and retrieved properly
✅ **File Operations**: Files can be listed and content can be read safely
✅ **Security**: Path traversal attacks are prevented (403 errors)
✅ **Integration**: Input files work seamlessly with Jinja2 rendering
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for various failure scenarios
✅ **User Experience**: Complete workflows function as intended
✅ **History Tracking**: All operations are properly logged

## Security Features Validated

- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents access to files outside configured directory
- **Input Sanitization**: Filenames are sanitized to prevent directory traversal
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files and configuration errors
- **Access Control**: Only files within the configured directory are accessible

## Production Readiness

The input files functionality is **production ready** with:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security measures in place
- Full integration with existing features
- Proper configuration management
- Complete test coverage

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Basic endpoint tests (quick)
python3 tests/unit_tests.py

# Complete workflow tests (thorough)
python3 tests/workflow_test.py

# User simulation tests (realistic scenarios)
python3 tests/user_simulation.py
```

All tests should pass with 100% success rate when the server is running on localhost:8000.
